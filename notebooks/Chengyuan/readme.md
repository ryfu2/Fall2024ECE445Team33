# Project Notebook: Chengyuan's Contributions  

## Week of 9/30  
**Task:** Implement basic HTTP communication.  
**Summary:** Set up foundational HTTP communication between the ESP32 and a local test server. Discussed with the team about overall server architecture and data flow.  

## Week of 10/7  
**Task:** Develop GPT API communication prototype.  
**Summary:** Built a prototype to communicate with GPT APIs. Tested sending basic text input and receiving output via HTTP requests. Ensured low-latency responses during initial testing.  

## Week of 10/14  
**Task:** Prepare the server and API calls.  
**Summary:** Deployed a Flask server locally and integrated it with the GPT API. Configured server endpoints to handle audio requests and return responses.  

## Week of 10/21  
**Task:** Test new microphones.  
**Summary:** Received the INMP441 microphones and tested them individually for sensitivity and signal clarity. Verified their performance using the development board.  

## Week of 10/28  
**Task:** Implement serial signal packaging into WAV format.  
**Summary:** Developed a module to package serial audio input into the WAV file format for transmission. Verified correct encoding and data integrity using test signals.  

## Week of 11/4  
**Task:** Test server communication with audio input/output.  
**Summary:** Integrated the server with audio input/output functionality. Successfully tested end-to-end audio data flow from input, through the server, and back to playback.  

## Week of 11/11  
**Task:** Integrate server and audio systems.  
**Summary:** Combined the audio system and server into one pipeline. Ensured smooth communication between components with minimal latency.  

## Week of 11/18  
**Task:** Hardware integration and full-system testing.  
**Summary:** Connected all subsystems onto the PCB and performed hardware-level tests. Addressed early bugs in communication protocols and ensured stable performance.  

## Week of 11/25 (Thanksgiving Break)  
**Task:** Optimize audio input/output.  
**Summary:** Compressed audio input data and resampled the output to optimize response time. Improved system latency by 50%, meeting performance requirements.  

## Week of 12/2  
**Task:** Debug and finalize system.  
**Summary:** Conducted thorough debugging of the integrated system. Re-soldered unstable connections and finalized the hardware for the demo.
