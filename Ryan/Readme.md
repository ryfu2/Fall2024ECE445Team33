# Project Diary: Ryan's Contributions

## **September 30**
- **Task:** PCB schematic design and component research.
- **Summary:** Began designing the PCB schematic and researched components essential for the project. Ensured compatibility with the design goals and explored tools for efficient PCB development.

## **October 7**
- **Task:** PCB layout design and overall design review.
- **Summary:** Worked on the PCB layout, refining the design with feedback from team members. Conducted a thorough review to identify areas of improvement.

## **October 14**
- **Task:** Ordering PCB parts.
- **Summary:** Finalized the component list and placed orders for PCB parts. Verified compatibility and ensured the accuracy of the specifications to avoid delays.

## **October 21**
- **Task:** PCB testing and debugging.
- **Summary:** Conducted initial testing of the PCB. The first version of the PCB cannot be programmed, hence we had to redesign a new PCB version with the EN pin controlled by a button. Identified issues with the circuits and spent time troubleshooting, documenting problems for future fixes.

## **October 28**
- **Task:** PCB voice input and output testing.
- **Summary:** Focused on testing the PCB's voice input and output features. Continued debugging to improve functionality, achieving better performance after iterative adjustments.

## **November 4**
- **Task:** Audio basic functionality and PCB reorder.
- **Summary:** Implemented basic audio functionality while addressing issues with previously ordered PCB components. Reordered the INMP441 microphone and coordinated with team members to ensure alignment.

## **November 11**
- **Task:** Advanced audio features and display improvements.
- **Summary:** Added advanced audio capabilities and enhanced the display functions for text output. These updates brought the project closer to the prototype stage in preparation for the mock demo.

## **November 18**
- **Task:** Prototype debugging and review.
- **Summary:** Debugged the prototype, focusing on reliability and performance. Participated in a mock demo, collecting valuable feedback for final adjustments.

## **November 25**
- **Task:** Fall Break.
- **Summary:** Soldered the new PCB design and figured out how to use the SH1106 text display controller. We also integrated all subsystems onto the new PCB and ensured the functionality of everything.

## **December 2**
- **Task:** Final demo preparation and debugging.
- **Summary:** Collaborated with the team to prepare for the final demo. Debugged and polished the system, ensuring seamless integration of all components. Successfully presented the demo.

## **December 9**
- **Task:** Final paper and presentation.
- **Summary:** Wrapped up the project by completing the final paper and preparing for the presentation. Delivered a successful presentation, highlighting the team's journey and accomplishments.
